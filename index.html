    My game is called Strat. U start off in a dark forest and in the back round is a highlighted button in red.(tap the button) As u tap it u sink into the floor falling deep through a tube to be thrown into water. U rise up from the water and you're in a cave and there are 2 tunnels.(left tunnel) or (right tunnel)and u pick the left tunnel, u find an axe and rope with a grapple on one end while exploring the tunnel(pick up axe and rope grapple or donâ€™t pick up items), u pick up items, and After getting those items there is a ledge and across from it is a canvas not to steep or deep, do u( jump down in canvas or use grappling hook to climb up ledge). U decided to climb up the ledge with the grappling hook and when u get up there is a zombie, do u decide to (use axe on zombie, or run past it). U decided to run past, when u run past the zombie u trip on a rock and you roll your ankle. Now the zombie is limping closer and closer to you. TO BE CONTINUED...<br>
